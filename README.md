The goal is to create a platform that not just meets the user's expectations for a modern RSS reader but exceeds them. With BDR Reader, you'll have everything you need to curate your news and articles your way.

Stay tuned as BDR Reader evolves, and thank you in advance for your support, feedback, and contributions â€“ they're vital for making BDR Reader an exceptional tool for everyone

## Motivations

BDR Reader is born out of a passion for simplicity and practicality, focusing on the essential features that truly matter for an enjoyable reading experience. The design philosophy behind BDR Reader is to create an interface that is clean and intuitive, allowing users to navigate through their feeds without any unnecessary clutter or distractions.

One of the core motivations for developing BDR Reader was to put control back into the hands of the users. In a world where online services are increasingly opaque and prescriptive in the way they present information, BDR Reader offers a refreshing opportunity for you to personalize and curate your content. With BDR Reader, you can tailor your feed sources, organize your reading categories, and adjust your viewing preferences to match your unique tastes.

Furthermore, BDR Reader aims to be accessible and open. It is developed with the open-source ethos in mind, meaning that the community is not only welcome, but encouraged to contribute. Whether it's by improving the code, suggesting new features, or even just reporting bugs, users can participate in the evolution of BDR Reader.

In summary, the creation of BDR Reader is driven by a commitment to offer a superior RSS reader experience that combines aesthetics, flexibility, and community-driven development. It's not just an RSS reader; it's a statement that good design, paired with functionality, results in a product you'll look forward to using every day.
